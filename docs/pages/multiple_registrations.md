Wireup supports registering the same class multiple times under different qualifiers through factories. 

A use case for this would be to have multiple services connected to resources of the same underlying type, 
such as maintaining two database connections: a main and a read-only copy.

## Example

Assume an application with two databases: A main one and a read-only replica. In these scenarios, the main
connection handles writes, and the read-only one will handle reads.

### Service registration via factories

```python title="db_service.py"
from typing import Annotated
from wireup import service, Inject

# Define a class that holds the base methods for interacting with the db.
class DatabaseService:
    def __init__(self, dsn: str) -> None:
        self.__connection = ...

    def query(self) -> ...:
        return self.__connection.query(...)


# Define a factory which creates and registers the service interacting with the main db.
# Register this directly without using a qualifier, this will be injected
# when services depend on DatabaseService.
@service
def main_db_connection_factory(
    dsn: Annotated[str, Inject(param="APP_DB_DSN")]
) -> DatabaseService:
    return DatabaseService(dsn)

# This factory registers the function using the qualifier "read"
# and requests the parameter that corresponds to the read replica DSN.
@service(qualifier="read")
def read_db_connection_factory(
    dsn: Annotated[str, Inject(param="APP_READ_DB_DSN")]
) -> DatabaseService:
    return DatabaseService(dsn)
```

### Usage

```python title="thing_repository.py"
from dataclasses import dataclass
from wireup import service


@service
@dataclass
class ThingRepository:
    # Main db connection can be injected directly as it is registered
    # without a qualifier, this makes it the "default" implementation.
    main_db_connection: DatabaseService

    # To inject the read connection the qualifier must be specified.
    read_db_connection: Annotated[DatabaseService, Inject(qualifier="read")]

    def create_thing(self, ...) -> None:
        return self.main_db_connection...

    def find_by_id(self, pk: int) -> Thing:
        return self.read_db_connection...
```
